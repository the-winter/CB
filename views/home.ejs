			<h3>Welcome to Red Peonies</h3>

			<p>
				Red Peonies (Crveni Bo≈æuri, pronounced Tsrvenee Bozhuree) is an amateur a cappella choir in Perth,
				Western Australia, primarily performing music that defines the Serbian heritage. Our repertoire includes
				a wide range of music spanning sacred and liturgic, folk, traditional and modern genres. We also enjoy
				performing music from other nations within the Balkans and beyond.
			</p>

			<p>
				Red Peonies was founded in January 2016 and is led by Jasna and Nada. It began as a dual harmony female
				choir and has since expanded to include bass and tenor vocalists. We are always happy to welcome new
				members. There will be plenty of help with pronounciation if you don't speak Serbian.
			</p>

			<p>
				We regularly perform at various events in Perth's Serbian community, and hope to extend our performances
				to the wider public as well.
